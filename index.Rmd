## What is ExoPlanet Tool?

An application that aims to provide a tool to help people exploring exoplanets data from different points of view and should be considered just as a first version model.

Exoplanets data has been obtained from [Open Exoplanet Catalogue][4] - [github repo][5], an open source database of all discovered extrasolar planets:

*"The Open Exoplanet Catalogue is a catalogue of all discovered extra-solar planets. It is a new kind of astronomical database. It is decentralized and completely open. We welcome contributions and corrections from both professional astronomers and the general public."*

[Wikipedia on Exoplanets][6]:

"An **exoplanet** or **extrasolar planet** is a planet that does not orbit the Sun and instead orbits a different star, stellar remnant, or brown dwarf. More than 1800 exoplanets have been discovered (1890 planets in 1189 planetary systems including 477 multiple planetary systems as of 17 February 2015)."

## Menu Bar

Exoplanets Tool is organized around four options available in the menu bar you can find at the top of the webpage. These Options are:

- **Tool**: access to the ExoPlanets Tool
- **CodeBook**: displays the interpretation of the variables used in the data an tool.
- **Help**: acces to this HELP
- **About**: a brief explanation of the aims of this application, the origin of the used data and a note on exoplanets.

## Tool

This option, *Tool*, is selected by default when the application starts. Here you'll find four tabs:

- **Table**: shows an exoplanets data table that allows filtering and searches.
- **Plot**: shows an scatter plot whose X and Y variables can be fully selected.
- **Histogram**: shows an histogram whose X variable can be fully selected.
- **KMeans**: applies KMeans algorithm to X and y variables (you can select any of the available) and present results in a scatter plot.


Every and each of these four tabs is organized this way:

- Left sidebar panel: here you'll find tools for filtering and selecting data to work with and how.
- Main panel: results are presented in this area.
